# 387 Final Project
# RC car/robotic car with Obstacle avoidance

The goal of this project was to add an embedded system. I did so by modifying a RC car that I bought off Amazon to accept Arduino Uno inputs to controll it. The specific inputs are that of an ultrasonic sensor. Once the sensor recognizes that you are about to run into an obstacle it retreats and turns around. The original goal was to be able to completely control the RC car from the Arduinop Uno, but that was no longer possible after multiple attempts to solder to the rightPin failed. Overall I am happy with my finished project and proud to present it to you!
